            situated in the Rocky Mountains. Banff is known for its mountains and natural beauty, along with its plant
            and animal life. The national park fuels the tourist industry in Western Canada. </p>
        <p>Banff has many attractions within its borders including numerous lakes fed by glaciers creating an iconic
