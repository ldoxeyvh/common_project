            <h3>Geographic Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Banff National Park is in Western Canada in the province of Alberta. It is near the city of Calgary and
                situated in the Rocky Mountains. Banff is known for its mountains and natural beauty, along with its
                plant
                and animal life. The national park fuels the tourist industry in Western Canada. </p>
            <p>Banff has many attractions within its borders including numerous lakes fed by glaciers creating an iconic
                turquoise color. Banff also borders numerous other national parks further boosting its attractiveness as
                a
                tourist location. Banff’s glaciers have been shrinking and may disappear in the next few decades. </p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>
                Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore,
                is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful
                Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
                100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
                Rocks! <a href="https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm">(source)</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
                Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
                Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
                from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
                Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
                the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
                regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
                otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
                skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
                road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
                winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail! (source:

            <!--https://italy4real.com/historic-sights-in-rome-that-everyone-should-visit/-->

            <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
            <p>The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,”
                Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the
                development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri
                urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New
                York City at an area of 496 mi2, is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and
                services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.
            </p>
            <p>The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome.
                Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish
                Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with
                mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those
                traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and
                the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome –
                are also worth a visit.

            <h3>Geographic Location: North America</h3>
            <p>
                Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra Nevada
                mountain range in California. It is famous for its gigantic sequoia
                and redwood trees, as well as its underground Crystal Cave. The park
                is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a
                million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant
                trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent
                flora and fauna.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
                General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at
                275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the
                people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is
                estimated to be around 2200 years old.
