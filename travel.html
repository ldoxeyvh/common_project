        <h3>Geographic Location: North America</h3>
        <p>Banff National Park is in Western Canada in the province of Alberta. It is near the city of Calgary and
            situated in the Rocky Mountains. Banff is known for its mountains and natural beauty, along with its plant
            and animal life. The national park fuels the tourist industry in Western Canada. </p>
        <p>Banff has many attractions within its borders including numerous lakes fed by glaciers creating an iconic
            turquoise color. Banff also borders numerous other national parks further boosting its attractiveness as a
            tourist location. Banff’s glaciers have been shrinking and may disappear in the next few decades. </p>

            <p>
                Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore,
                is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful
                Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
                100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
                Rocks! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
                Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
                Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
                from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
                Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
                the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
                regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
                otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
                skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
                road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
                winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail! (source:
