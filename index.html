                    <img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
                </div>
                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different
                    beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                    long as
                    he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                    wanting to
                    admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                    toys "a
                    ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling. </p>

                </div>
                <p>Mocha is a very energetic little dog. His favorite activities are tug-of-war with toys,
                    playing fetch with his orange ball, and laying on his dad’s lap. He has so much energy
                    that in the evenings he tends to ‘get the zoomies’ in which he sprints in circles around
                    the house without any stimulation.</p>
                <p>When Mocha is done playing, he loves to lay down in an especially silly way. He lays on his
                    belly with his rear paws pointed straight backwards as shown in the following photos. It’s his
                    favorite way to recharge after a long day of play.</p>

                    named Jesse. Luke’s favorite thing to eat are chicken cat treats.</p>
                <p>Luke is very badly behaved. He often jumps up on furniture and drinks out of people’s water glasses.
                    He
                    also steals people’s jewelry and hides it in his bed. Luke knows several commands; he can sit, jump,
                    follow, play fetch, and give people his paw.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch.
                    Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with
                    him.
                    At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to
                    let
                    them know that he wants pets. </p>
                <p>Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits
                    with
                    eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart
                    and
                    will only do tricks when you present him with snacks. </p>

                    <img src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling.">
                </div>
                <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and
                    treats
                    (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with
                    his
                    toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.</p>
                <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really
                    excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and
                    wags
                    his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.
